1) Retrieve the docker login command that you can use to authenticate your Docker client to your registry:
aws ecr get-login --region eu-west-1

2) Run the docker login command that was returned in the previous step.
3) Build your Docker image using the following command. 
docker build -t docker-images .

4) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag docker-images:latest ACCOUNTNUMBER.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docker-images:latest

5) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push ACCOUNTNUMBER.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docker-images:latest


ECR URL for future references:arn:aws:ecr:eu-west-1:ACCOUNTNUMBER:repository/docker-images
